## 4. **How I Can Use This Knowledge in the Future:**

- **Strengthening My Technical Versatility:** Seeing how Cubis, Lytix, and Aivix specialize in different stacks (SAP, Microsoft, Python) emphasized the importance of being adaptable and multi-skilled. It’s a reminder that learning multiple tools expands the scope of problems I can solve—and the teams I can collaborate with.

- **Improving Communication of Complex Insights:** Lytix’s focus on making data clear and visual really hit home. No matter how advanced my models or data pipelines are, their impact is limited unless I can communicate them effectively. This experience reinforces my motivation to work on storytelling and visualization as much as technical modeling.

- **Applying Real-World Thinking to My Work:** Intellus doesn’t deal with abstract or theoretical problems—they help real companies solve real challenges. It showed me how essential it is to build solutions with tangible outcomes in mind, something I can apply whether I’m analyzing space data or optimizing business operations.

- **Sharpening My Collaboration Mindset:** The synergy between sub-companies reminded me how important it is to build data projects with teamwork in mind. Understanding where my work fits in a bigger system—whether infrastructure, reporting, or machine learning—is something I’ll take with me into future internships, group work, or professional roles.

- **Reflecting on Career Flexibility:** Even though I’m passionate about data in the space industry, this experience opened my eyes to how rewarding other paths can be. There’s value in exploring different sectors, and I now see consultancies like Intellus as potential career options that still align with my data interests.
