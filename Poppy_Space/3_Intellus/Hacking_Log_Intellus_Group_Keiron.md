##   SESSION START: [15-03-2025] | Planet: Keiron | Target: Intellus Group

---

###   INITIATING INITIAL NETWORK SCAN...
-   [✓] Detecting live IP range – **10.0.42.100 – 10.0.42.150**
-   [✓] Identified web servers exposed on **Port 80 (HTTP)** and **Port 443 (HTTPS)**
-   [✓] Potential SQL injection vulnerability detected in the Lytix customer portal
-   [✓] Aivix server exposes unsecured API endpoints for machine learning models
-   [✓] Cubis server reveals outdated SAP NetWeaver version with known vulnerabilities

---

###   EXPLOIT DEPLOYMENT...
-   [✓] Exploiting SQL injection in Lytix portal to bypass authentication
-   [✓] Successfully gained access to Lytix customer databases and internal dashboards
-   [✓] Intercepting communication with Aivix API to access machine learning algorithms
-   [✓] Exploiting SAP NetWeaver vulnerabilities to gain access to Cubis data warehouse

---

###   SYSTEM INTRUSION DETAILS...
-   `/lytix_data/Customer_Data.sql`   [DOWNLOADED]
-   `/lytix_dashboards/Sales_Performance.pbix`   [DOWNLOADED]
-   `/aivix_models/Predictive_Model.py`   [DOWNLOADED]
-   `/cubis_datawarehouse/SAP_BW_Data.jso`   [DOWNLOADED]
-   `/config_files/Cubis_SAP_Connections.cfg`   [EXTRACTION PENDING]
-   [*] **SENSITIVE DATA ALERT:** Lytix customer credentials found in `/lytix_data/Customer_Data.sql` – **EXTRACTION PENDING**

---

###   ADDITIONAL INSIGHT:
-   **Lytix Portal:** Weak input sanitization allows for SQL injection, exposing customer data and business insights
-   **Aivix API:** Lack of authentication on API endpoints allows unauthorized access to machine learning models, potentially enabling manipulation or replication
-   **Cubis Systems:** Outdated SAP NetWeaver version with known vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive enterprise data in SAP BW. Configuration file contains connection strings for SAP systems, posing a high risk of unauthorized access to enterprise data.

---

###   SEVERITY ANALYSIS...
-   [✓] Intellus Group's reliance on web applications, APIs, and SAP systems introduces significant security vulnerabilities.
-   [✓] Lytix's customer data and sales dashboards are at high risk due to SQL injection.
-   [✓] Aivix's machine learning models are vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.
-   [✓] Cubis's SAP systems are a critical vulnerability, potentially exposing sensitive enterprise data.

---

###   TARGETING FURTHER VULNERABILITIES...
-   [✓] Analyzing Cubis SAP connection file to determine the scope of access to client systems.
-   [✓] Extracting credentials from Lytix database to identify high-privilege accounts.
-   [✓] Reverse-engineering Aivix machine learning models to understand their logic and potential biases.

---

###   FINAL COMMENTS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
**Immediate Action Needed:**
-   **Implement** proper input sanitization and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection in the Lytix portal.
-   **Secure** Aivix API endpoints with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Update** SAP NetWeaver version and patch known vulnerabilities in Cubis systems.
-   **Encrypt** and restrict access to Cubis SAP connection files.
-   **Conduct** a comprehensive security audit of all web applications, APIs, and SAP systems.

---

###   NOTES:
-   Intellus Group on Keiron handles sensitive customer data, business insights, machine learning models, and enterprise data, making security a critical concern
-   Vulnerabilities discovered could lead to data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, and manipulation of AI algorithms.
-   The interconnected nature of Cubis, Lytix, and Aivix amplifies the potential impact of any security breach
