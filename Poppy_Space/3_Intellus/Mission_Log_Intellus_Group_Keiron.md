--------------------------------------------------------------
Astronaut ID: [Rynn]
Mission Status: **Active**
Date: [15-03-2025]
Location: **Keiron (Intellus Group HQ)**
Objective: **Infiltrate and gather critical data from Intellus Group's network.**
Mission Commander: [Poppy Space – Elite Hacking Team]
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Mission Overview:**
Intellus Group is a data consultancy on Keiron, composed of three main companies: Cubis, Lytix, and Aivix. They handle the full data pipeline, from raw data processing to business insights and AI innovation. My objective was to infiltrate their network, extract confidential data related to their operations and client projects, and return undetected.

This was a complex operation due to the interconnected nature of Intellus Group and the diverse technologies they employ.

**Phase 1: Entry and Initial Recon**
Upon arrival at Intellus Group HQ, I observed a multi-layered security system, including network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control protocols. Initial scans revealed potential entry points through unsecured API endpoints and vulnerabilities in their web applications.

I focused my entry strategy on exploiting a vulnerability in Lytix's customer portal, as indicated by our reconnaissance team.

I bypassed the initial network defenses and gained a foothold in their system.

**Phase 2: Navigating Intellus Group's Network**
Once inside, I navigated Intellus Group's network, which was segmented into different zones for Cubis, Lytix, and Aivix. Cubis's systems relied heavily on SAP technologies, Lytix used the Microsoft data stack, and Aivix focused on Python-based analytics and machine learning.

I moved laterally through the network, identifying key data repositories and communication channels.

It was evident that Intellus Group heavily emphasizes data-driven solutions, making it a valuable target for intelligence gathering.

**Phase 3: Breaching the Data Vaults**
I targeted the core data repositories of each company:

* For Lytix, I accessed their customer databases and sales performance dashboards.
* For Aivix, I gained access to their machine learning models and related algorithms.
* For Cubis, I infiltrated their SAP BW data warehouse, containing sensitive enterprise data.

I extracted files containing customer credentials, business insights, AI models, and SAP connection configurations.

During the data extraction from the Cubis data warehouse, an alert was triggered, indicating unauthorized access.

**Phase 4: Data Extraction Under Pressure**
With the system's security measures being alerted, I prioritized the extraction of critical data:

* Lytix's customer credentials.
* Aivix's predictive models.
* Cubis's SAP connection configurations.

I initiated a rapid data transfer while simultaneously masking my intrusion within the system logs.

The network became increasingly unstable as security protocols attempted to isolate the affected systems.

**Phase 5: The Escape**
With the primary data secured, I initiated my exit strategy.

I retraced my steps, eliminating any traces of my presence within the network.

I successfully exfiltrated the network, leaving Intellus Group unaware of the intrusion.

**Final Reflections**
The mission was successful. I obtained valuable data pertaining to Intellus Group's operations, client data, and technological infrastructure.

Intellus Group's reliance on diverse technologies and interconnected systems presents both opportunities and vulnerabilities for future operations.

The extracted data will provide Poppy Space with insights into data consultancy practices, client data management, and AI development on Keiron.

The operation's success underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures in protecting sensitive data in interconnected business environments.
