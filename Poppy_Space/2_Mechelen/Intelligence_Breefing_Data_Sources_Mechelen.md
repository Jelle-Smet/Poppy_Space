# **INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING**
## **OPERATION: RETALIATION**

---

**CLASSIFICATION:** TOP SECRET â€“ EYES ONLY
**DATE:** 29/02/2025
**AUTHORIZED BY:** Poppy Space Cybersecurity Division 
**MISSION STATUS:** INITIATED

---

## **1. BACKGROUND**

On 2049-02-28, Poppy Space detected **anomalous data flows originating** from Avanos Prime. Preliminary analysis indicates potential vulnerabilities in their city management systems, including:

-   Unsecured data transmission channels
-   Outdated city operating system
-   Weak access control protocols

Preliminary forensic analysis traced the attack back to multiple sources operating under the cover of **Mechelen City Center**

This presents an opportunity to gather **intelligence on Avanos Prime's data infrastructure**, citizen data handling practices, and security vulnerabilities.

---

## **2. OBJECTIVES**

1.  **Identify critical data systems:** Map Avanos Prime's data infrastructure and identify key systems for data collection and management.
2.  **Exploit system vulnerabilities:** Gain unauthorized access to Avanos Prime's systems to extract sensitive data.
3.  **Analyze data handling practices:** Assess how Avanos Prime collects, stores, and utilizes citizen data.
4.  **Identify security weaknesses:** Uncover vulnerabilities in Avanos Prime's systems that could be exploited for future operations.
5.  **Maintain covert operation:** Ensure all activities remain undetected to avoid compromising future access.
