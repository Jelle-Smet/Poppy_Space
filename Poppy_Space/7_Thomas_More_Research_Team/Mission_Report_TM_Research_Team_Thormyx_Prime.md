# MISSION REPORT: **Thomas More Research Team (Thormyx Prime)**  
**Mission Date:** 21-04-2025 – 25-04-2025  
**Agent:** Rynn – Data Specialist & Embedded Analyst, Poppy Space

## 1.  **General Intel & Fieldwork Summary:**  

Over five days embedded with the Thomas More Research Team on Thormyx Prime, I executed a full-on data-driven mission focused on **urban crowd dynamics and conversion patterns** (2023-2024), specifically in Ostend—a vital node for understanding human flow and behavior on this planet.

My role? Dig through layered datasets, stitch them together, and extract actionable intel on who moves where, when, and why—then forecast future crowd surges using Prophet, our time-bending data oracle.

IRL, this meant:  
* Defining sharp research questions to keep the mission laser-focused  
* Collecting and merging diverse data streams: visitor counts, spending habits, weather fluctuations, and local events  
* Cleaning and prepping raw data with surgical precision using Python’s pandas and numpy  
* Running advanced analyses—correlations, descriptive stats, and time series forecasts  
* Visualizing patterns to reveal Ostend’s crowd pulse and event impacts  

This wasn’t just academic—it was a prototype for how Poppy Space can decode alien city rhythms and predict societal flows across planets.

## 2.  **What I Saw: Data Patterns & Impacts**  

The intel was rich and clear:  

* **Visitor Rhythms:** Weekly cycles showed clear dips on Mondays/Tuesdays and weekend spikes—classic, but vital for optimizing resource flow.  
* **Seasonal Waves:** Annual visitor patterns peaked in summer, bottomed in winter—like planetary orbits, but for people.  
* **Event Impacts:** Easter holidays pumped up visitor counts by +14,000, while summer holidays caused dips of -16,000. Even local festivals like the Shrimp Croquette Festival sent numbers soaring by +16,000.  
* **Conversion Fluctuations:** Events didn’t just bring crowds—they shifted buying behavior, sometimes up, sometimes down. Holiday vibes matter.  

These patterns are the lifeblood of urban logistics and crowd management—essential data for any space agency mapping population movements on new worlds.

## 3.  **IRL Ops: What I Actually Did**  

* Designed and refined research questions that drilled into the heart of urban movement and spending  
* Merged heterogeneous data from Ostend’s visitor logs, transaction records, meteorological feeds, and event schedules  
* Cleaned datasets like a surgeon—renaming columns, fixing types, aggregating daily visits—to make data models precise  
* Employed Prophet for time series forecasting—training models to anticipate visitor surges and drops with uncanny accuracy  
* Visualized complex relationships through Python’s matplotlib, turning numbers into storyboards of city life  
* Learned how subtle factors—like weather or an obscure festival—could swing crowd behavior and conversion rates  

Hands-on, real-world data science applied in a live environment. This mission was the perfect template for Poppy Space’s goal: mastering how data shapes not just Earth cities, but entire planetary ecosystems.

## 4.  **Key Learnings & Twists for Poppy Space**  

1. **Data Cleaning is Mission Critical:** Raw data is messy, and prep work is the unsung hero of any operation. Without clean data, forecasting is just guesswork.  
2. **Cross-Domain Data Fusion:** Combining weather, events, and spending data reveals holistic insights—just like interplanetary data fusion in Poppy Space.  
3. **Event Influence Is a Double-Edged Sword:** Knowing when crowds spike is good, but predicting how it affects conversion adds a crucial behavioral layer.  
4. **Forecasting Powers Planning:** Prophet’s forecasts let us see into the data future, crucial for both city ops and off-world colonization missions.  
5. **Real-World Data Science = Real-World Impact:** This project taught me the full cycle—from questions to clean data, to insights, to practical recommendations—exactly the pipeline Poppy Space thrives on.

## 4. **How I Can Use This Knowledge in the Future:**

- **Mastering Data Prep:** This mission drilled in that clean data isn’t optional—it’s the foundation. I’m leveling up my ETL game for any future space or Earth projects where garbage in = garbage out.

- **Fusing Multi-Source Data:** Seeing how weather, events, and spending interplay is like the ultimate playlist of urban life. I’ll apply this fusion mindset to future datasets, especially when handling complex planetary ecosystems.

- **Behavioral Layers Matter:** Predicting crowd size is just step one—understanding how behavior shifts with events is next-level insight I’m hyped to chase.

- **Forecasting as a Tool, Not a Crystal Ball:** Prophet gave me a glimpse into probable futures. I’ll use it (and other models) as decision-making aids, not some magic oracle.

- **Scaling from City to Cosmos:** This was a test run for Poppy Space’s bigger mission—to decode and predict human (and alien) behavior on any planet. Lessons here = groundwork for that leap.

## 5.  **Final Reflections: Why This Matters**  

The Thomas More research project was more than a campus gig—it was a test run for the kind of deep-dive data ops Poppy Space needs to master for planetary-scale intel.  

Understanding human behavior at the urban level teaches us how to scale up—how to predict, manage, and ethically govern crowds and resources on any world we touch.  

The mission reshaped how I see data not just as numbers, but as signals from living systems—signals Poppy Space can track, decode, and maybe someday, influence.
